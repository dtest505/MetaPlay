Send commands to msfconsole menu driven

Just a quick down and dirty cheesy bash script/menu to make working with msfconsole a bit quicker.
	Supports config files for different clients/targets.
	Main menu is configureable via .cfg file.
	Opens 2 other terminals and starts msfconsole in one. 
	The other is for shell commands, hydra, nmap, etc.


At its core it relies on the tool ttyecho.
