Send commands to msfconsole menu driven

Just a quick down and dirty cheesy bash script/menu to make working with msfconsole a bit quicker.

Its based on the tool ttyecho
(can be found here:  http://www.humbug.in/2010/utility-to-send-commands-or-data-to-other-terminals-ttypts/   )

Feel free to edit to fit your needs.
